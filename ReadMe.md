# Zero, first and second conditionals

Conditional sentences express a condition (If ...) and the consequence of the condition. To draw attention to the condition, put it at the beginning of the sentence:

*If I want to discuss something important with my friends, I usually phone them and arrange to meet.*

To draw attention to the consequence, put the condition after:

*I'll call you tonight if I have time.*

**Note: in writing, if the condition comes first, a comma is used. If the consequence comes first, no comma is used.**

## Zero conditional
If/Unless + present tense, present tense:

*If I don't have a lot of homework to do, I go out with my friends.*

It is used to express something which is always or generally true.

## First conditional
If/Unless + present tense, future tense / modal verb (can, should, must, etc.):

*We can go to the park tomorrow if it doesn't rain.*

*If I get high enough marks in my exams, I'll study biology at university.*

It expresses a future condition which the speaker thinks is possible or likely.

## Second conditional
If/Unless + past tense, would/could/might + infinitive:

*If my parents weren't so busy, I'd spend more time with them.*

It expresses an imaginary, impossible or improbable present or future condition:

*If I lived in California, I'd eat ice cream every day.* (imaginary â€” she doesn't live in California)

*If they offered me fifty thousand dollars a year, I'd accept the job.* (improbable that they'll offer fifty thousand dollars)
